# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, organized by year. Solutions are not optimized with respect to any specific metric: they are neither the shortest nor the fastest possible solutions. Instead, they are cleaned-up versions of my initial solutions, or even sometimes a solution inspired by the Reddit Solution Megathreads.

## Repository Structure

- **`shared/`**: Shared utilities and libraries used across multiple years.
  - **`rust_aoc_lib/`**: A reusable Rust crate containing helpful structs, algorithms, and other utilities.

- **Year-Specific Directories**:
  - **`year2024/`**: Solutions implemented in Rust.
  - **`year2023/`**: Solutions implemented in Rust.
  - **`year2025/`**: Solutions implemented in C++.

## Running Solutions

Refer to the `README.md` inside each year's directory for specific instructions on running the solutions.

Inputs for each puzzle are not included in this repository, as they are unique to each Advent of Code participant. However, most solutions are general solutions that will work with any valid input that adheres to the given problem's rules. You can retrieve your own inputs from the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) website.
